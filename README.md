## Project Overview

This project analyzes four years of transactional sales data from AdventureWorks to evaluate overall business performance, with a focus on profit trends, product performance, customer behavior, and geographic insights. The goal was to identify patterns, highlight key drivers of profitability, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

1. Analyze profit performance over four years

2. Identify trends by time, product, and customer location

3. Evaluate customer demographics and purchasing behavior

4. Provide actionable business insights

## Business Questions

- How has total profit evolved over four years?

- Which products and customers contributed most to profit?

- How do different countries and demographics affect profitability?

- What are the key trends in the most recent year?

## Tools and Methods Used

- Microsoft Excel
    - Power Query Editor – Data cleaning and transformation
    - Power Pivot & Data Models – Table relationships and data modeling (Sales, Products, Customers, Geography, and Date)
    - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Key metrics calculations (Number of transactions, Total number of products, Total number of sold and unsold products, %Profit margin, Total number of customers, and average customer age)
    - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – Visual analysis and reporting

## Key Analyses Performed

- KPI comparison with previous year (Revenue, COGS, Profit, Profit Margin, Transactions)

- Yearly performance metrics

- Monthly, quarterly, and weekday profit trends

- Profit by week type (weekday vs weekend)

- Top 5 profitable products and customers

- Profit by pricing type and product color

- Profit by gender, age group, and country

## Summary of Key Insights

- Profit growth was driven mainly by high-priced products, weekday sales, and older customer segments.

- The United States and Australia together contributed over 60% of total profit.

- Products priced above $150 generated over 95% of total profit.

- Profit was broadly distributed across customers, indicating low dependence on a few high-value clients.

- 2025 profit appears lower than 2024 because the dataset only includes data up to July 2025.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize high-priced products that generate most of the profit

- Rationalize the product portfolio since many products are unsold

- Strengthen performance in low-profit periods (especially Q3)

- Focus weekday operations and promotions on peak profit days

- Maintain strong presence in core markets (USA & Australia)
